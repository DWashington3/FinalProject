# Meeting Saturday 8am -10am 

# Final Project
- Jake
- Lawrence 
- Sheri 
- Diamond
# Hypothesis: 
1.	Does the moon phase affect the calls for service? 
Dates: 2018- 2021 
DATA:   Date, time, moon phone aggregated with calls to service. (Gainesville)

# ROLES: 
-	Repo management: (Diamond)- general research about the moon phases, the theory and creating the backbone to a well written analysis. 
-	Mockup ML: (Lawrence)- an idea of the possible algorithms to create this automation
-	Mockup Database w/ sample data: (Sheri)- cleaned CSV data, tables thinking about creating
- Technologies Used:  possible dependencies and imports (Jacob)

# Technology Used
## Data Cleaning
Jupyter Notebook and Pandas will be used to clean the datasets.  Python will be used for further analysis 

## Data Storage
Postgres will be the database used.  We will query and join the datasets utilizing SQL.  

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the library that will be used.  We will be using K-Nearest Neighbor, RandomForest and Naive-Bayes

## Dashboard
We will use Tableau for visual displays.  A flask template and D3.js will be used for a fully functioning interactive dashboard


Common point deducations
o	Need average 5 plus commits from everyone. 

OTHER NOTES: 
Finding if there is a strong relationship between the models.  The strength of the correlation then allows us to make an easier link for causation. Why might these things be correlated.  Machine learning is all predictive and doesnâ€™t actually understand.
