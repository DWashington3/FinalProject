# Hypothesis:

Dates: 2018- 2021 
DATA:   Date, time, moon phone aggregated with calls to service. (Gainesville)

# ROLES: 
-	Repo management: (Diamond)- general research about the moon phases, the theory and creating the backbone to a well written analysis. 
-	Mockup ML: (Lawrence)- an idea of the possible algorithms to create this automation
-	Mockup Database w/ sample data: (Sheri)- cleaned CSV data, tables thinking about creating

# Technologies Used:  possible dependencies and imports (Jacob)
o Microsoft Office CSV For Excel
o Python

o	Postgres
o Jupyter Notebook
o	Pandas
o	Tableau
o Machine Learning
o	Dashboard


Common point deducations
o	Need average 5 plus commits from everyone. 

OTHER NOTES: 
Finding if there is a strong relationship between the models.  The strength of the correlation then allows us to make an easier link for causation. Why might these things be correlated.  Machine learning is all predictive and doesnâ€™t actually understand.
